# Complaint-Management-System
##This is my first program in Github. This project tells about creation of a simple database using the inputs gathered from the end user. The details received from the end user are about the complaints on the product. This program has been written in Python language. For receiving the inputs from the end user, I have created a simple user interface using Streamlit. The database has been created in MySQL where the inputs are stored within a table under the database created specifically for this project. Upon successful completion of entering all the required fields, the end user shall receive a statement that the inputs received are stored in the database.
